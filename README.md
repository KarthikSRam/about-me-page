#Karthik's About Me Page

##Technologies used

The project is built using HTML for the page data, CSS for styling, and JavaScript and jQuery for interactions and DOM manipulations.

##Process/Approach

I relied heavily on the example site given in the project description, but made sure to make changes to make it my own in terms of styling and color choices. I also tried to modularize the development of the project by feature, developing one feature completely before moving on to the next.

I also used a separate branch named "test" as the development branch and developed exclusively on that branch, only merging with master once I got a particular feature working.

##Unsolved Problems

Currently I have not been able to get the lightbox modal that pops up when a particular project is clicked on working, I am still working on it.

##Biggest Wins/Challenges

The biggest win I encountered was getting the smooth scrolling to particular sections of the site to work. I struggled with it for a long time, but got help from Justin who pointed out that I needed to prevent default behavior of anchor tags in order for the page to not reload when links are clicked.
