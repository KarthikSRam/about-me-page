- For consistency consider downloading your `bootstrap.min.js` file as well.
- Replace your lorem ipsum with some content about you!

- `$(document).on (ready, function(){})` will load AFTER the html has finished loading. `$(window).on(load, function(){})` may create timing errors (rare, but possible)

-  Your javascript is VERY clean and easily readable! Great work!  Remove unused or commented out code from your production version of codebase.

- Your CSS is beautiful, clean, and very concise!  For organization, consider ordering your selectors by tags, classes, then IDs. This shows you the specificity of your selectors at a glance.
